## Project Overview

TrackIt - simple task management tool for small teams.
Tech stack: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5, Maven. Tests with JUnit 5 and MockMvc.
Frontend: Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript, PrimeVue. Database: PostgreSQL 17.

This is the Java line of the TrackIt lab project. The Python line lives in
`acend-swai/lab-trackit` and carries the same domain.

## Architecture

- backend/src/main/java/ch/acend/trackit/
  - web/ - REST controllers, one per resource (e.g. TaskController.java)
  - service/ - business logic, one per resource (e.g. TaskService.java)
  - domain/ - records and enums, no framework annotations
  - dto/ - request payloads with validation annotations
  - repository/ - Spring Data interfaces, one per entity
  - TrackitApplication.java - the Spring Boot entry point
- backend/src/test/java/ch/acend/trackit/ - tests, mirroring the main package
- backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/ - Flyway migrations, one per change
- frontend/src/
  - api/ - one module per resource, all HTTP through `api/client.ts`
  - views/ - one component per route, named `<Thing>View.vue`
  - components/ - reusable pieces, no HTTP calls of their own
  - router/index.ts - every route registered here and nowhere else
- docs/adr/ - one file per architectural decision

## Coding Standards

- Java 21, records for value types, no Lombok
- Constructor injection only, never field injection
- Four spaces, no tabs. One class per file
- Controllers are annotated `@RestController` with `@RequestMapping("/api/v1/...")`
- Test classes use `@WebMvcTest(TheController.class)` and inject `MockMvc`
- Test method names read as a sentence: `postTaskReturnsCreated`
- Validation annotations belong in `dto`, never in `domain`
- A controller test mocks its service with `@MockitoBean`. `@Import` of a real
  service only works while that service reaches nothing outside itself
- Vue components use `<script setup lang="ts">`, never the options API
- A view calls `api/`, never `axios` directly

## Persistence rules

- Storage is PostgreSQL, reached through Spring Data JPA
- The JPA entity is a SEPARATE class in `domain`, e.g. `TaskEntity`. Never annotate
  the record - the record stays the API shape when the storage changes
- One `*Repository` interface per entity, extending `JpaRepository`
- Table names are plural snake_case, e.g. `tasks` for `TaskEntity`
- The schema is created by a Flyway migration, never by `ddl-auto`.
  `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` MUST be `validate`
- Migrations are named `V<n>__<snake_case_description>.sql` and are never edited
  once committed
- The datasource URL, user and password come from environment variables with a
  development default, never a hardcoded production value

## Frontend rules

- One API module per resource in `frontend/src/api/`, exporting typed functions
- Types mirror the backend record field for field
- A view owns its loading and error state and renders both
- New route goes into `router/index.ts`; nothing else registers routes
- The dev server proxies `/api` to port 8080, so URLs stay relative

## Constraints

- DO NOT add a dependency to pom.xml or package.json without saying so first
- DO NOT put business logic in a controller
- DO NOT return a `dto` type from a controller - return the domain record
- DO NOT read or write anything under `secrets/`
- DO NOT edit files outside the subsystem you were asked to change
- Every new endpoint MUST have at least one MockMvc test
- Every schema change MUST arrive as a new Flyway migration

## Git rules

- Commit before every non-trivial task
- Commit as soon as a slice runs green
- No amend on an accepted commit
- No force-push

## Entity Model

- Task: id (long), title (String), project (String), status (OPEN or DONE)

Tasks live in memory in `TaskService` until lab 1.2 moves them into PostgreSQL.
